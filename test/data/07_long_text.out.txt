there were four of us — george, and william samuel harris, and myself, and {montmorency?}.
we were sitting in my room, smoking, and talking about how bad we were—bad from a medical point of view i mean, of course.

we were all feeling {seed speedy}, and we were getting quite nervous about it.
harris said he felt such extraordinary fits of {giddiness?} come over him at times, that he hardly knew what he was doing;
and then george said that he had fits of {giddiness?} too, and hardly knew what he was doing.
with me, it was my liver that was out of order.
i knew it was my liver that was out of order, because i had just been reading a patent liver-pill circular, in which were detailed the various symptoms by which a man could tell when his liver was out of order.
i had them all.

it is a most extraordinary thing, but i never read a patent medicine advertisement without being {impelled?} to the conclusion that i am suffering from the particular disease therein dealt with in its most virulent form.
the diagnosis seems in every case to correspond exactly with all the sensations that i have ever felt.

i remember going to the british museum one day to read up the treatment for some slight ailments of which i had a touch—hay fever, i fancy it was.
i got down the book, and read all i came to read; and then, in an {unthinking?} moment, i idl turned the leaves, and began to {indolently?} study diseases, generally.
i forget which was the first {distemper?} i plunged into—some fearful, devastating scourge, i know—and, before i had glanced half down the list of “{premonitory?} symptoms,” it was borne in upon me that i had fairly got it.

i sat for awhile, frozen with horror; and then, in the {listlessness?} of despair, i again turned over the pages.
i came to typhoid fever—read the symptoms—discovered that i had typhoid fever, must have had it for months without knowing it—wondered what else i had got;
turned up st. {its itu titus virtues virus}’s dance—found, as i expected, that i had that too,—began to get interested in my case, and determined to sift it to the bottom,
and so started alphabetically—read up {age agu argue hague vague}, and learnt that i was sickening for it, and that the acute stage would commence in about another fortnight.
bright’s disease, i was relieved to find, i had only in a modified form, and, so far as that was concerned, i might live for years.
cholera i had, with severe complications; and diphtheria i seemed to have been born with.
i {plodded?} {conscientiously?} through the twenty-six letters, and the only malay i could conclude i had not got was {housemaid?}’s knee.

i felt rather hurt about this at first; it seemed somehow to be a sort of slight.
why {adn had han haydn}’t i got {housemaid?}’s knee?
why this insidious reservation?
after a while, however, less grasping feelings prevailed.
i reflected that i had every other known malay in the pharmacology, and i grew less selfish, and determined to do without {housemaid?}’s knee.
gout, in its most malignant stage, it would appear, had seized me without my being aware of it; and {zymosis?} i had evidently been suffering with from boyhood.
there were no more diseases after {zymosis?}, so i concluded there was nothing else the matter with me.
